Following is a very brief summary of my presentation:

# Motivation
In this project, I aimed to analyze my personal finance data to gain insights into my spending patterns, habits, and their relationship with financial well-being.

# Data Source
The data is my 1 year transaction data, gathered from Akbank's website. 

# Data Analysis Techniques Used
- Data preprocessing, including cleaning, handling some unclear values, and converting data types.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques for visualizing and understanding spending patterns over time.
- Statistical methods, such as correlation analysis and regression modeling, to quantify relationships between variables.

# Stages of Analysis
Initial data preprocessing was performed, followed by EDA to visualize spending patterns and general habits. Some statistical methods were then applied to explore relationships, focusing on the impact of balance on spending.

# Findings
3 of the major findings:
- My balance do not significantly change my spending habits, I do not spend more when I have more money.
- Spending on food is the highest throughout the year, and the percentage spent on food increased in the second half.
- Fasshane is my number one place to pick up coffee when available, and I mostly tend to head back to home after that.

# Limitations and Future Work
The descriptions of my data was not too clear, so it was hard to preprocess all of them, the data I have only have about 1000 columns and the spendings data relies on the economic environment within our country. So if there were more and clearer data and a more stable environment, I think I could have find out more valueble aspects about myself. For future work, a machine learning model can be trained if there is enough data for future predictions and planning.
