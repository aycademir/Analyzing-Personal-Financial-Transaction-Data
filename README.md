## Summary Of The Project

##### Motivation
In this project, I aimed to analyze my personal finance data to gain insights into my spending patterns, habits, and their relationship with financial well-being.

#### Data Source
The data is my 1 year transaction data, gathered from Akbank's website. 

#### Data Analysis Techniques Used
- Data preprocessing, including cleaning, handling some unclear values, and converting data types.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques for visualizing and understanding spending patterns over time.
- Statistical methods, such as correlation analysis and regression modeling, to quantify relationships between variables.

#### Stages of Analysis
Initial data preprocessing was performed, followed by EDA to visualize spending patterns and general habits. Some statistical methods were then applied to explore relationships, focusing on the impact of balance on spending.

#### Findings
- My balance do not significantly affect my spending habits, I do not spend more when I have more money. Even for the shopping spendings my balance does not affect my spending much.
- Around 0.4 positive Spearman correlation coefficient suggests that there is a moderate positive relationship between the count of Yemek Sepeti transactions and the proportion of spending on food. In other words, as the count of Yemek Sepeti transactions increases, there tends to be a moderate increase in the percentage of spending on food.
- The number of times I order from Yemek Sepeti has increased in the second half of the year compared to the first half, indicating that I have developed a habit of eating at home more frequently.
- Spending on food is the highest throughout the year, and the percentage spent on food increased in the second half.
- The number of times I drink coffee has significantly increased in the second half.
- Fasshane is my number one place to pick up coffee when available, and I mostly tend to head back to home after that.
- After Fasshane, among the things I most frequently do, there are expenses from Gürsel and Yemek Sepeti. This indicates that I am inclined to go home after sitting at Fasshane.
- One of the significant differences between the first and second halves is transportation. In the second period, I had a car, and my expenses for Gursel and taxi decreased significantly. Instead, I developed a habit of stopping at Opet while coming to school.
- During my weekends, I seem to have a consistent habit of doing grocery shopping at Migros.
- The more I spend on food, the more I spend on cafes. The more I spend on cafes, the more I spend on the market. The more I spend on the market, the more I spend on food. The more I spend on fun, the more I spend on shopping.

#### Limitations and Future Work
The descriptions of my data was not too clear, so it was hard to preprocess all of them, the data I have only have about 1000 columns and the spendings data relies on the economic environment within our country. So if there were more and clearer data and a more stable environment, I think I could have find out more valueble aspects about myself. For future work, a machine learning model can be trained if there is enough data for future predictions and planning.
